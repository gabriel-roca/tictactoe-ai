Tic Tac Toe AIs developed for MAP4112 at UCF

### How To
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/maxfer1221/tictactoe-ai && cd tictactoe-ai`
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Test the sample runner with `python3 main.py`
The current runner uses agents that randomly select a spot on the board, and exits when one of the players attempts to make an illegal move.
